**Project overview**
This website is for a small exclusive bookstore holding classical literature by well known authors over the centuries. The staff are interested in holding a list of authors that are of particular interest to them and the books that they have published. Guests can view these authors and books but cannot update or create any records only staff can. The bookstore website is targeted to book sellers and book readers who enjoy books.

**UX/UI**


**Goals** 

To make the website simple and uncluttered in appearance. To aid in immediately identifying features such as authors and book listings and edit, create and delete features. 

**Design choices**

The schema should be basic and simple in design using primary and foreign keys. Minimising the number of tables (models) required. This will also simplify the design of templates but provide all the required functionality.
