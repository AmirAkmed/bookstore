**Project overview**
This website is for a small exclusive bookstore holding classical literature by well known authors over the centuries. The staff are interested in holding a list of authors that are of particular interest to them and the books that they have published. Guests can view these authors and books but cannot update or create any records only staff can. The bookstore website is targeted to book sellers and book readers who enjoy books.

**List of features**

**Login**

Staff are required to login to be able to create, delete and edit records. ****They can simply register with an username and password.


**UX/UI**


**Goals** 

To make the website simple and uncluttered in appearance. To aid in immediately identifying features such as authors and book listings and edit, create and delete features. 

**Design choices**

The schema should be basic and simple in design using primary and foreign keys. Minimising the number of tables (models) required. This will also simplify the design of templates but provide all the required functionality.

**User stories** 

- As a new user, I want to quickly and easily find the features. 

- As a new user, I want to quickly find a list of books.

- As a new user I want to quickly find a list of authors.

- As a new user I want to be able to quickly and easily create, edit and delete author records.

**Testing**

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### **Unfixed Bugs**<a id="unfixed-bugs"></a>

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.




**Deployment**


Kanban board!

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab

  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch

  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

**Citation of ALL sources(code,images, text)**


In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.


### **Content**<a id="content"></a>

- The text for the Home page was taken from Wikipedia Article A
